(26, '<h2>IT staffing services</h2>\n<p>We ensure that you get the best professional the first time, faster than your internal HR can source a person. We handle the hours of candidate screening, reference checking, rate negotiation and interviewing that frequently takes so much of your time.</p>\n<p>Once the Dimensional Account Manager has a thorough understanding of your internal systems operation, or that of your customer\\''s, a specific technical requirement is prepared. Our proprietary system matches candidate\\''s skill sets with your requirements using specific algorithms. At which point, the technical recruiter performs a detailed manual review of each resume, using his or her years of technology knowledge to &quot;read between the lines&quot; to determine whether the technical specialist has the depth of experience required to ensure your project\\''s success. Next, the recruiter places numerous screening calls to the most select professionals. Thorough technical interviews are conducted, and three job relevant references are checked with professionals who have worked in a managerial capacity over the candidate.</p>\n<p>Screening for precise technical skills and competency is only a small part of our rigorous selection criteria. Our consultants must share our commitment to the successful outcome of your over-all project. Does this person share our commitment to maintaining integrity? Will this person &quot;jump ship&quot; mid-stream? Does the candidate seem driven too much by money? ...these are some of the most important questions. Careful attention is placed on the assessment of the candidates principals and interpersonal skills. If our comfort level with a candidate is very high, then pay is negotiated and confirmed. If the candidate is technically a perfect match, but does not represent our core values, we will not submit the candidate to our client. Our client relationship is more important than the placement of a consultant.</p>\n<p><img width=\\"190\\" height=\\"257\\" align=\\"left\\" alt=\\"teaming\\" src=\\"/demo/images/woman3.jpg\\" /></p>\n<p>We guarantee our service.
